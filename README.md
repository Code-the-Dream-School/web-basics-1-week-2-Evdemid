# Week 2. Build it from the ground up. 

Create issues on the link below on the parent repo if you are stuck and want to talk about it. You can paste code, tag people and refer to other issues there. Link here: https://github.com/Code-the-Dream-School/web-basics-1-week-2



This one should be fun(-ish).

1. Wireframe out the front-page of your personal portfolio page with any tool you choose. It should contain links to other pages, maybe some information about yourself, possibly some information about your portfolio. Don't worry about color, font, or content yet. Just think about the sections you need and a basic layout for the web.

2. Inside of your forked assignment repository create an issue, called "Wireframe for portfolio" and attach a screenshot of your portfolio front page wireframe to the issue ticket. 

3. Clone, and install your repository on your machine. 

4. Create and checkout a new git branch from your machine in your repository called 'setup'

5. Correctly link a styles.css and an index.js javascript files into your index.html page. 

6. In the javascript file create a function that displays an alert that says "Welcome to a new journey and my new site" (or anything you want to alert really. 

7. Add and commit your changes. Create a commit message that says, "Added files and set up javascript alert". Push your branch back up to your remote by using the git push origin setup. 

8. Using what you know about HTML and CSS try begin trying to create an HTML structure that might match your wireframe. Think in sections and chunks and how sections are divided into subsections. Give divs class names that match your sections and reuse class names where it makes sense. 

9. Don't worry about colors or fonts. Using the css that you have already been taught begin trying to build a layout that matches your wireframe. Don't worry about getting it right, this will be hard, if not impossible to achieve. Document your questions, thoughts, etc. We will go over them in the mentor sessions.

10. Add and commit your changes. Create a commit message that says, "Checked in some css and html". Push your branch back up to your remote by using the git push origin setup. 

11. Create a pull request from your new setup branch back into master. Approve your pull request. 

12. Checkout your master branch. Run 'git pull origin master'. 

13. High five the monitor if when viewing your master branch you have all of your changes from the setup branch.
